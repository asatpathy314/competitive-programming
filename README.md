I'm not good at this, so I'm trying to learn.

## Configuration
On an M3 Mac do the following in order to use `bits/stdc++`.

1. Create a `bits` directory inside `/usr/local/include`. You may need to use sudo.
2. Create a new header file inside the directory `bits` under the name `stdc++.h`.
2. Copy the content from https://gist.github.com/sachin-kmr/ee03a0d07be6fcfd439b49307a12f7ed into the new file.

Voila! All done.
